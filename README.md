# Open Data Board Game

The Open Data Board Game is a board game built around the creation of tools using data.

This repo will contain all the things that are needed to create the game. It is a work in progress as we move from prototype to production.

## How to create the cards

Assuming you already have rvm installed:

```
$ rvm use 2.2
$ bundle install
$ rake
```

Look in the `_output` folder for the generated cards.
